## Description
Python-based machine learning exercise, utilizing emails
and financial dataset from Enron to determine persons of
interest.

## Result
It's possible to manipulate the finanical data in such
a way as to outperform and make obsolete the metadata
that we derived from the email dataset.

## Installation Requirements
You will need to install the following python libraries:
* numpy
* pickle
* sklearn
* math 

It should also be noted that this code has only been
tested on python version 2.7 any other version is at
your own risk.
